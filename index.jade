              p I came out as a chubby, summer baby at the ripe, young age of 0. However, don't let looks deceive you. I was a devious child, and I hope the world was ready for me.

              p With a pair of freshly sharpened pencils and a shiny, new eraser, I was off to Kindergarten to learn all the wonderful things school had to offer. Unfortunately, the only thing I learned that day was that American school lunches were far from what I imagined.

              p After several screams, crashes, and scraped knees, I finally earned my wheels. I could now be where I wanted, when I wanted and had to report to nobody... At least until I was tired and hungry after biking all day and needed to come home for dinner.

              p I planned on using my first computer for school, but I ended up playing more flash games on it than I'd like to admit. Luckily, Netflix was not around back then or my productivity would have dropped even further. However, this laptop really sparked my interest in computers and led me to study computer science. Thanks Mom and Dad!
